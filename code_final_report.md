# Comprehensive Multimodal Fake News Detection: A Comparative Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of multimodal fake news detection using the Fakeddit dataset. We implemented and evaluated three distinct approaches: text-only, image-only, and multimodal fusion models. Our analysis provides quantitative evidence for the effectiveness of multimodal fusion while highlighting the practical trade-offs and deployment considerations for real-world fake news detection systems.

**Key Findings:**
- Multimodal fusion demonstrates superior performance compared to single-modality baselines
- Class 4 (manipulated content) shows the highest performance across all models
- Text-only models struggle with class imbalance, particularly for minority classes
- Image-only models provide complementary information for visual manipulation detection
- Diffusion layers enhance feature quality and model robustness

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Fake news detection has become a critical challenge in the digital age, with misinformation spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Traditional approaches often focus on single modalities (text or images), but modern fake news increasingly combines both textual and visual elements to create more convincing false narratives.

### 1.2 Dataset Overview

The Fakeddit dataset provides a comprehensive multimodal fake news detection benchmark with:
- **Total Samples**: 564,000 training, 59,342 validation, 59,319 test samples
- **Modalities**: Text (titles) and images
- **Classes**: 6-way classification system
  - Class 0: True content
  - Class 1: Satire
  - Class 2: False connection
  - Class 3: Manipulated content
  - Class 4: Misleading content
  - Class 5: Imposter content

### 1.3 Research Objectives

1. Implement and evaluate single-modality baseline models (text-only and image-only)
2. Develop a multimodal fusion model with diffusion enhancement
3. Provide comprehensive quantitative comparison across all approaches
4. Analyze class-wise performance patterns and identify strengths/limitations
5. Generate practical recommendations for deployment scenarios
